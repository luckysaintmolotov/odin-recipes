    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>

Thanks to the air fryer, you can enjoy homemade chips anytime!

These air-fryer potato chips make the perfect snack. 
They’re a crispier, crunchier version of your favorite store-bought chips, only without the excess grease. 
You need just four ingredients to pull them off: potatoes, cooking spray, salt and an optional garnish of fresh parsley for a fresh touch. 
The best part about these chips is that they don’t take all day. The pre-soaked potato slices will crisp up to a gorgeous, golden-brown hue 
in about 15 minutes

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
    <ul>
        
        <li>2 large potatoes</li>
        <li>Olive oil-flavored cooking spray</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>Minced fresh parsley, optional</li>
        <li>Paper Towels</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

        <li><h4>Prep the potatoes</h4></li>
        <p>Preheat the air fryer to 360°F. Cut the potatoes into thin slices using a mandoline or vegetable peeler. 
            Transfer them to a large bowl.
            Add enough ice water to cover. Soak for 15 minutes. Drain. Add more ice water, and soak for an additional 15 minutes.</p>
        
        <li> <h4>Dry the potato chips</h4></li>
        <p>Drain the potatoes. Place them on towels, and pat dry.</p>
        
        <li><h4>Air-fry the potato chips</h4></li>
        <p>Spritz the potatoes with cooking spray, and sprinkle them with salt. In batches, cook the potatoes in a single layer on a greased tray in the air-fryer basket. 
            Cook until crisp and golden brown, 15 to 17 minutes, stirring and turning potato slices every five to seven minutes.
            Remove the potatoes from the air fryer, and repeat the process with the remaining potatoes. If desired, sprinkle the chips with minced fresh parsley.</p>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Recipe Variations</h2>
    <ul>

    <li><strong>Pepper</strong>: Give the chips a little kick with ground black pepper. Add it when you season the potato chips with salt.</li>
    <li><strong>Salt and vinegar</strong>: Sprinkle the chips with distilled white vinegar powder after cooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Sour cream and onion</strong>: After cooking, dust the chips with a mixture of buttermilk powder and onion powder. Ranch dressing and dip mix also works here, but it adds a more assertive flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Barbecue chips</strong>: After cooking, toss the chips with barbecue seasoning or a dry rub. Feel free to add extra cayenne or chili powder to adjust the spice level according to your preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Dill</strong>: Swap in chopped fresh dill for the parsley to give the chips a dill-pickle spin.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: Use a Microplane grater to add finely grated Parmesan to the cooked chips. To keep the recipe vegan, you can use nutritional yeast instead (although you may need to spritz the chips with water first to help the powder stick).</li>

</ul>
