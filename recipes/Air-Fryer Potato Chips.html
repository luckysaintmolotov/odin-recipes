    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
These crispy air-fryer potato chips require just four ingredients, and one of them is optional. 
Thanks to the air fryer, you can enjoy homemade chips anytime!

These air-fryer potato chips make the perfect snack. 
They’re a crispier, crunchier version of your favorite store-bought chips, only without the excess grease. 
You need just four ingredients to pull them off: potatoes, cooking spray, salt and an optional garnish of fresh parsley for a fresh touch. 
The best part about these chips is that they don’t take all day. The pre-soaked potato slices will crisp up to a gorgeous, golden-brown hue 
in about 15 minutes

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
    <ul>
        
        <li>2 large potatoes</li>
        <li>Olive oil-flavored cooking spray</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>Minced fresh parsley, optional</li>
        <li>Paper Towels</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Set a mandoline on the thinnest level and carefully cut potato into thin slices.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add sliced potatoes to a bowl of water and soak for 15 minutes. Pour out water, cover potatoes with fresh water, and soak for an additional 15 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Meanwhile, preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray.</p></li>
            <li><p> Remove potatoes from the water and dry thoroughly. Sprinkle with smoked Cheddar salt and transfer to the air fryer basket, making sure not to overcrowd it. Spray the potatoes with cooking spray.</p></li>
            <li><p>Air fry potatoes for 8 minutes. Open air fryer and shake potatoes. Cook until potatoes are golden brown, about 7 minutes more. Check to make sure they are not cooking faster and starting to burn.</p></li>
        </ol>
    
    <h2>Recipe Variations</h2>
    <ul>

    <li><strong>Pepper</strong>: Give the chips a little kick with ground black pepper. Add it when you season the potato chips with salt.</li>
    <li><strong>Salt and vinegar</strong>: Sprinkle the chips with distilled white vinegar powder after cooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Sour cream and onion</strong>: After cooking, dust the chips with a mixture of buttermilk powder and onion powder. Ranch dressing and dip mix also works here, but it adds a more assertive flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Barbecue chips</strong>: After cooking, toss the chips with barbecue seasoning or a dry rub. Feel free to add extra cayenne or chili powder to adjust the spice level according to your preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Dill</strong>: Swap in chopped fresh dill for the parsley to give the chips a dill-pickle spin.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: Use a Microplane grater to add finely grated Parmesan to the cooked chips. To keep the recipe vegan, you can use nutritional yeast instead (although you may need to spritz the chips with water first to help the powder stick).</li>
